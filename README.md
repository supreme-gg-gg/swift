Just some random notes from learning Swift and SwiftUI I guess, pretty much purposeless here lmao. 
Do note that due to a stupid mistake (and my laziness to correct it) the code are created as "Pages" in a single playground called "Swift" ðŸ˜‚
There also contain a few SwiftUI app examples following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=6sujKFQMKe1iS6W4&v=b1oC7sLIgpI&feature=youtu.be)
