## Swift Notes

Just some random notes from learning Swift and SwiftUI I guess, pretty much purposeless here lmao. 

You can simply clone this repository and open the project in XCode. Each file will be interpreted as a Swift playground (similar to Jupyter Notebook or Matlab LiveScript). 

There also contain a few SwiftUI app examples following the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=6sujKFQMKe1iS6W4&v=b1oC7sLIgpI&feature=youtu.be)
